This project aims to create a web application that manages the daily expenses of its users. Each user will have to register and login to use the app. Once logged in, the user will be able to see their spending logs ordered by the entry time. Clicking on an entry would provide the details associated with that expense. A separate section will allow the user to log their expenses where they may also specify the payment method used.
